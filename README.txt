This is some detail for the tutorial "Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders". The tutorial is based on "Anomalies, Representations, and Self-Supervision" (arXiv:2301.04660). The aim here is to reproduce the upper left panel of Figure 1 of arXiv:2301.04660.


First "AE_anomalydetection.ipynb" is a ready-to-run Jupyter notebook with data files "background50k.npy" and "signalAto4l.npy". The first one is a 50k ensemble of constructed SM events, while the latter one is a new physics sample of pseudoscalar A -> Al. First, ensure all the prerequisite modules and packages are installed. For less computationally heavy machines, readers are requested to download the file with 20K events.
